This is a group project done by Tobiloba Adeleke, Cohort1-blended ALX SE students at Sprint 1 C-programming

This project was initially meant to be a collaboration, but I had to detach from my partner because of the individual's unavailability.

I learnt immensely from this project. It was,, no doubt challenging. Several commits, rewriting, restructuring and refactoring of codes every now and then, and then pushing it to github and running the checker to see if there are more green checks or more red ones. All in all, it aroused passion in me for coding, perseverance and resilience, focus, deep work, tarrying till purpose is achieved, and above all, grit.

This is a form of e-diary. There are more projects ahead, and ALX has it in for us, but I believe that, sometime in the nearest future, when I look back at this repository, I would be doing that with my ALX Completion certificate in my hand.

All good things!

Task 0:
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
- c
- s
- %

Task 1:
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

- d
- i

Task 2:
Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

- b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

Task 3:
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

- u
- o
- x
- X

Task 4:
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

Task 5:
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

Task 6:
Handle the following conversion specifier:
- p

Task 7:
Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:

- +
- space
- #

Task 8:
Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:

- l
- h
Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

Task 9:
Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 10:
Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 11:
Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 12:
Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 13:
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- r : prints the reversed string

Task 14:
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- R: prints the rot13'ed string

Task 15:
All the above options work well together.
Well done on completing this project! Let the world hear about this milestone achieved.
